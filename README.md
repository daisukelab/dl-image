# Practical Machine Learning Image Application Toolchain

This repository is continuously updating to provide aggregated information/tools for practical real-world application for following goals:

- clf: Image Classication
- od: Object Detection
- imagenet: Imagenet
- (TBD) Identity Verification
- (TBD) Pose Tracking
- (TBD) Semantic Segmentation
- (TBD) Style Transfer
- (TBD) High Resolution

## Motivation

Many great datasets and sophisticated models are available online.
But in many cases, it takes extra effort to make our own applications:

- Dataset is too big to extract what we need.
- Models and solutions require special data format to train for our own.

This repository helps reshaping great resources for making out own application easier.

## Scope

- Tools for reshaping dataset for application use.
- Information & example of applications.

Not in this scope: Models, datasets.

## Future works

Many TBD will be done in the future.
